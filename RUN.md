The step to run the code:  
1, This code will only work in Windows operating system, since the some packages and library I used are only compatible and work for Windows.  
2, Use $git clone$ plus the link from the github.    
3, Use $cargo run$ to run the keylogger.  
4, Use Right Ctrl button to start to record the arranged keys actions.  
5, Use ESC to stop the keylogger. (note: if you do not stop it, it will keep running. You can also shut down the terminal to stop it).
