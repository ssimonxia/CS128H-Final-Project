The step to run the code:  
1, This code will only work in Windows operating system, since the some packages and library I used are only compatible and work for Windows.  
2, Use "git clone" plus the link from the github.    
3, Use "cargo run" to run the keylogger.  
4, Use "Right Ctrl" button to start to record the arranged keys actions. If it does not show you the managed result, you can press right ctrl button more heavily and try again. Sometimes, it will not work because I did not press the button heavily.  
5, Use "ESC" to stop the keylogger. (note: if you do not stop it, it will keep running. You can also shut down the terminal to stop it).   
6, You can go to the bin folder to see the results of the keylogger.    
7, Besides, originally, the code will show you the encrypted results, which may not be understandable. If you want to see the original result, you need to change codes in line 139. You need to change "s_unscrambled" to "s" to see the normal results. Also, you need to change the code at line 328 and 329. You need to mark out these two lines to see the managed keylogger results.     
8, One thing to keep in mind. For the managed results, since it is overwritten from the previous work, if you have 3 lines for the first test and 2 line for the second, the result of the second test will contain the result of the first one. It is normal.
